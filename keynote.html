<h2>Beyond Java: Expanding Refactoring Research to Multiple Programming Languages</h2>

<p>
    Traditionally, academic research on refactoring has focused on Java programs. 
    However, in recent years, other programming languages are gaining momentum and are being used to build highly-successful applications. 
    In this talk, I will first motivate the need to expand research on refactoring to support other programming languages. 
    Second, I will argue this support is not only an engineering and portability issue; by contrast, 
    it demands major changes in the tools and algorithms previously developed by researchers in the area. Finally, 
    I will present our current effort to evolve and redesign <em>RefDiff</em>&mdash;our refactoring detection tool&mdash;to 
    work with multiple languages and programming paradigms.
