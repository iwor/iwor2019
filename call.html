<h2>Workshop overview</h2>
<p>
    Successful software products evolve through a process of continuous change as bugs are fixed, new features added, 
    and quality issues addressed. Refactoring supports the volatile software lifecycle by providing better ways to 
    reduce and manage the growing complexity of software systems while improving developer productivity. 
    Refactoring can be performed at all levels from requirement specification down to source code level, and, in essence, 
    involves improving the internal structure of a software artifact without altering its functionality. In spite of the popularity of 
    refactoring both in practice and as a research topic, many open questions remain, particularly in terms of understanding how refactoring is 
    performed, measuring the impact of refactoring, and improving tool support in all areas of refactoring.
